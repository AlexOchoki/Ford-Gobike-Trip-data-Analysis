## Ford GoBike Dataset

- This dataset contains 183412 entries of bike rides and 16 columns with various information about each bike ride trip.
- The data row entry describes the duration of each bike ride trip in seconds, detailing the start time and the end time of the trip.
- The data also has the start_station_id and end_station_id which uniquely identify the locations in which the users started and ended their bike rides. 
- There are also attached coordinates in terms of longitudes and latitudes of these unique locations, which can help get the distance between stations
- Each entry also has the unique identification of the bike used, the user type and their gender together with the year the user was born.

## Summary of Findings

- Trip duration histogram, it is right skewed with the most duration being about 500 seconds.
- Most bike users were male
- Most of the users were subscribers and the rest were customers
- The users year of birth distribution histogram is right skewed
- The trip duration seemed to be higher with the users born after 1980
- There is negative correlation between age and trip duration

## Key Insights for Presentation

- Most of the bike users were male, comprising of over 86% of the total users. Most of these users are subscribers and the the rest customers.
- Further analysis into the age distribution shows that most users were between ages 25 to 45 years. As the age increases the number of bike users also significantly decreases.
- Most of the users start their bike trips at two peak times in a day: 8 A.M and 5PM. This is the duration where there is highest activity in starting and ending trips. 
- Lowest activity in bike usage (starting and ending trips) is experienced between 9PM and 6AM. There is moderate bike usage between 10AM and 3PM before the demand starts rising.
- The younger users (24-45) years old have the highest trip duration from the analysis and then the duration decreases with increase in age.
